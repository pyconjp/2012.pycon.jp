Python Type and Object
======================
This presentation is to explain type and object concept in Python object model.
To understand the type and object is useful when you try to understand metaclass
proramming in Python, especially when you are confused the attribute you want to
modify is a type attribute or a class attribute or a object attribute.

I would like to introduce how an object be created and how a class be created.
then introduce how I write a meta class to trace all phase of creating
an object.

If you are new to meta class programming, you may want to check this slide
"What can meta class do for
you"(http://www.slideshare.net/hychen/what-can-meta-class-do-for-you-pycon-taiwan-2012)

Implement High-Performance PDE Solvers for First-Principle Simulations by Using Python
======================================================================================
Aided by its powerful gluing capability, Python can be used to build simulation software that demands high performance.  As performance hotspots being replaced by C, the software can be organized by using Python for a clear structure.  The resulting software provides high flexibility along with high performance.  In this talk, SOLVCON, a Python-based software framework for solving conservation laws, is used to demonstrate the approach.
