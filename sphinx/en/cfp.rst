====================
 Call for Proposals
====================

The call for talk proposals for PyCon JP 2012 is now open! Is there a talk you want to give on a topic that interests you? Do you want to introduce the community to a library or useful piece of Python software?

Talks proposals may be submitted in English or Japanese. Please specify the language of your presentation when submitting your talk proposal. We have increased the number of available slots for English presentations so we are especially looking for talks in English. Don’t hesitate to apply!

25 minute and 45 minute time slots are available. 25 minute time slots are limited so we encourage you to submit 45 minute talk proposals. As there are more 45 minute time slots, 45 minute talks are more likely to be accepted.

PyCon JP is a community conference. We are not able to compensate speakers and we ask that speakers purchase a regular conference ticket. However, we have arranged for for some SWAG and goods for conference speakers.

Announcement of the conference theme column is for reference only. There is no disadvantage to submitting talk topics outside of the conference theme. Feel free to submit talk proposals about any topic that interests you!

Although the number of tracks has increased, if the number of applications exceeds the number of available slots, applications will be screened by the PyCon JP Program Committee. We will notify applications of the results by July 24. We have limited time slots so we ask for your cooperation and understanding.

We encourage talks to be video recorded so that community members who couldn’t attend the conference can learn from your talk. Whether you allow recording of your talk or not will not affect the selection process, but we encourage recording of talks.

We look forward to your talk!
